- Atom (Text editor)

# Running / Viewing the Project
## Command Line
1. First, make sure that you have your terminal open. Information about your terminal can be found here:<br/>
   -Mac: https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac<br/>
   -Windows: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/
2. Next, check if you have the C compiler already installed in your system. If you are using the UNIX / Linux operating systems in your terminal, then you likely have a C compiler called GCC in your system. To determine if you already have GCC installed in your system, type `cc` or `gcc` in your terminal. The C programming language is already built into your system (regardless of what computer / operating system you have). For more information on C and C compilers, click the link below. <br/>

3. On this repository page, go to the "Code" button and click the "Download Zip" option.
4. Go to your "Downloads" section on your computer and place the zip file in a folder/location other than "Downloads".
5. Double click on the zip file to open or "unzip" it so you can access the file contents.
6. In your opened terminal, navigate to the location where you opened the downloaded zip file and make sure you are inside of the "Office-Hour-Simulation-master" folder. (If you are unsure of command line commands, see the resources provided bellow.)<br/>
   -Linux and Max: http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html<br/>
   -Windows: https://blogs.umass.edu/Techbytes/2014/11/14/file-navigation-with-windows-command-prompt/
7. Inside the "Office-Hour-Simulation-master" folder on your terminal, navigate into the "src" folder.
8. Inside of the "src" folder, type the following command: `gcc -o simulation NAME OF PROGRAM.c`. We are using the C compiler in this step to create an executable file for the program that we name "simulation".
9. After typing the command above, type this command: `./simulation NAME OF TEXT FILE -ARGUMENT`. Here we are running the compiled version of the program (the executable file), which we named "simulation". We also pass the text file, included in this project, into the program to be read and analyzed. The argument flag at the end of the command tells the program what kind of algorithm to run in the program.
10. After running the command in the previous step, output should be printed out on your terminal window. Information about the output is provided below.
    -blah blah blah...
    -blah blah blah
11. ADD A STEP HERE???
12. Try using the other argument flags, "-a", "-d", and "-q" when you run the office hour simulation program. Also, try running the program using the other files, infile2.txt and infile3.txt.

DELETE WHEN YOU FINISH PROJECT DESCRIPTION
To indicate that FIFO is to be used, then ”-f” is given as the first command-line argument. To indicate that advising appointments are prioritized, “-a” is used. To indicate that project demos are prioritized, “-d” is used. To indicate that project questions are prioritized, “-q” is used.

Example input files have been provided in the forms of infile1.txt, infile2.txt, and infile3.txt.
The input file has the following components:
• Name of the professor (char *)
• Minutes of Office Hours for Monday (int)
• Minutes of Office Hours for Tuesday (int)
• Minutes of Office Hours for Wednesday (int)
• Minutes of Office Hours for Thursday (int)
• Minutes of Office Hours for Friday (int)
• Number of students (int)
• For each student, the following is given:
– Name of the student (char *)
– Type of visit (Q for question, D for demo, A for advising)
– Visit length in minutes (int)
– Days the student is available (one character per day, with R representing Thursday)
